          <h1>Why Web Design?</h1>
          <br>
          <p>I chose Web Design as the career I wish to pursue. After being enrolled in a class that went over HTML I coding websites as something I would like to do. </p>

           <h1>Why do I believe it to be a useful skill? </h1>
           <br>
           <p>I believe knowing how to code a website can be useful in many fields. Possing this knowledge can not only land a job but can also be used for person use. If you decide to sell a product or start a website such as eBay or Craigslist, you can save lots of money by not having top pay someone else to code the webiste for you.</p>

           <h1> What is my future Career path?</h1>
           <br>
            <p>My future career plan involvesne pursuing the career of a Web Designer. I found interest in coding websites when I took Web Design I. Web Design has always interested me though, sometimes when I view a website I think to myself, I wonder how they made that website. Websites can carry many stories, just like a picture, it can contain 1,000 words.
